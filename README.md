🧮 Python Assignments – PLP Academy

This repository contains all my Python assignments while learning at Power Learn Project (PLP) Academy.
Each assignment is a small, fun project that helps me practice different Python concepts and improve my coding skills. 😄

✨ What’s Inside

Each  file is a different assignment:

Week One – Simple Calculator
A basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers with friendly “welcome” messages.

Week Two – pythonWeekTwoass


......


… and so on. Each week introduces new Python concepts like loops, lists, functions, and more.

💻 How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the folder of the assignment you want to run.

Run the Python file, for example:

python calculator.py


Follow the prompts and enjoy the program! 😎

📝 Notes

These programs are beginner-friendly and meant for learning.

Some spelling mistakes and funny messages are intentionally kept for fun vibes. 😆

Each program usually asks for user input and then shows results immediately.
