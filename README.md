🧮 Simple Calculator – PLP Assignment

This is a fun little calculator built in Python as part of my Power Learn Project (PLP) assignment.
It can add, subtract, multiply, and divide — just like a real calculator… but with more “welcome” messages! 😄

✨ Features

➕ Addition – Adds two numbers

➖ Subtraction – Subtracts one number from another

✖ Multiplication – Multiplies two numbers

➗ Division – Divides one number by another (but warns you if you try dividing by zero 🚫)

📜 How It Works

The program welcomes you to the calculator.

You enter the first number.

You choose an operator: +, -, *, x, or /.

You enter the second number.

The program calls the right function and shows your result.

💻 How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

Save the code in a file called calculator.py.

Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

python calculator.py


Follow the prompts to calculate!

📝 Example Run
wel come to culculating
enter the first number : 8
enter operator : *
enter the second number : 3
wel come to multiplication part
result is: 24.0

📌 Notes

This program is case-insensitive for multiplication — you can use * or x.

Division by zero will not crash the program. It will simply tell you it’s invalid.

The spelling of “wel come” and “culculating” is left in for extra fun vibes. 😆
